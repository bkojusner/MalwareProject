<h3>What is this</h3>
Here is the code for the ransomware itself. </br>
Just run the make command and the executable is in /bin </br>
Run executable as sudo! </br>

side note: the .o stuff is generated after compilation </br>

<h3>How it works:</h3></br>
1. Creates an AES Key </br>
2. Scans and gets the files from whatever directory was given </br>
3. Encrypts the files that were detected using the AES Key, randomly generated iv, and OpenSSL EVP Magic </br>
4. SHOULD then delete the original file and leave an encrypted version of the file ending in .jnw </br>
5. Creates thread which extracts computer's MAC address and come artifacts </br>
6. Hashes these two values together in a reversable manner to generate some validation key </br>
7. Has a check using Luhns algorithm to verify if a credit card is valid or not </br>
8. If everything works out, it should move on to the decryption portion of the code </br>
9. Ransomware is done messing with you </br>

<h3>What is missing</h3>
- [ ] API Connection </br>
- [ ] Prive Esc Connection </br>
- [ ] Generalization of MAC Address obtaining method </br>
- [ ] TESTING </br>
